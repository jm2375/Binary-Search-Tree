# Binary Search Tree

This is a Java implementation of a binary search tree. It uses recursive, iterative, and object-oriented principles to complete the insertion, removal, and searching of data within the tree structure.

## How it Works

The binary search tree functions by accepting data elements and organizing them in a hierarchical structure based on their values. Upon insertion, the tree dynamically adjusts to maintain its binary search property, ensuring that left children are lesser and right children are greater than their parent nodes. Navigation of this tree allows for insertion, removal, and searching operations to take place.
